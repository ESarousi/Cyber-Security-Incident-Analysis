# Cybersecurity Threat Analysis (2015–2024)

This project analyzes global cybersecurity incidents from 2015 to 2024 using a Kaggle dataset:  
[Global Cybersecurity Threats (2015–2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-cybersecurity-threats-2015-2024)

## Project Overview

Over 3,000 incidents are examined to uncover patterns in:

- **Country of occurrence**
- **Year of incident**
- **Attack type** (e.g., Malware, DDoS)
- **Attack method** (e.g., Phishing, SQL Injection)
- **Estimated financial impact** (in millions USD)
- **Response time** to resolution

## Objectives

1. **Descriptive Analysis**  
   Explore statistical distributions and trends across attack types, methods, and geographies.

2. **Predictive Modeling**  
   Use machine learning to forecast the financial impact of future incidents based on historical data.

3. **Feature Evaluation**  
   Identify which factors most strongly influence financial damage.

## Machine Learning Frameworks Used

- **Scikit-learn** – Baseline regression models  
- **TensorFlow** – Deep learning architectures  
- **PyTorch** – Custom neural networks  
- **XGBoost** – Gradient boosting and feature importance analysis
